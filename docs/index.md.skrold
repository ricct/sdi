On-premises, cloud and hybrid cloud are supported. While connecting to the cloud, it is possible to establish a secure link via the SDI web service without setting up a VPN.  
Oracle, SQL Server, MySql, PostgreSql, DB2, ODBC, files (CSV, Excel , JSON , XML) are supported. File systems, FTP/FTPS, SFTP, AWS S3, OCI Object Storage are supported for importing source files and exporting.  
It is possible to retrieve and integrate data from web services and web APIs.  
The scheduler is provided that lets you define the automatic data integration at a specific time.
